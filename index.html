			Never think of health when you eat burgers. Diet experts say that one serving of meat should be nearly 3 ounces which is around the thickness of a deck of cards. In Nevada, Las Vegas, there is a restaurant that offers what is called by its owner – ‘nutritional pornography’. The restaurant’s name is Heart Attack Grill! They have something called Quadruple Bypass Burger. This burger is made of 4 half-pound beef slices, 8 American cheese slices, 20 bacon slices, 20 lard baked caramelized onion slices, one tablespoon mayonnaise, two tablespoon ketchup, 8 tomato slices, one tablespoon mustard and one bun. Do you have any idea of how many calories you get in one Quadruple Bypass Burger? It is 9,982 calories!

			<p>One of the most expensive burger to be ever sold was FleurBurger5000. That thing was made of black truffles, foie gras and Kobe beef. The burger was served along with Chateau Petrus, 1990 bottle. It was sold in Las Vegas’ Fleur de Lys. Can you guess the price? It was a staggering $5,000 for one burger!</p>

			<p>Veggie burgers aren’t really as healthy as you may think them to be. Widely popular in India, veggie burgers (you won’t get beef burgers even in McDonald’s in India) include soy which is made of hexane. Hexane is an air pollutant which is a by-product of gasoline refining. This hexane isn’t really a good thing. An Apple factory worker died in 2010 because of hexane poisoning while he was using that substance to clean touchscreens of Apple devices.</p>

			<p>Louis Lunch exists even today but their specialty is that they offer only three condiments – onions, tomatoes and cheese spread. Mayonnaise, mustard and ketchup are strictly forbidden and if someone is caught smuggling in any forbidden condiment into the cafe, he or she is politely asked to leave the place!</p>
